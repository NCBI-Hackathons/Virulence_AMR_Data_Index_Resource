# Virulence_AMR_Data_Index
Indexing and Visualization for AMRs and Virulence Genes in Genomes and Metagenomes

Use cases:
1. Find accession/contig by taxonomy
2. Find accessions/contig by gene (durg resistance, virulence factor)
3. Find accession/contig by genes cluster
4. FInd accession/contig by domain
5. Find accession by host
6. Find similar SRR/contigs
7. Find accession/contig by seuqence

Compound Searches
* 1+(2/3/4/5/6)
* (2/3/4)+(5/6)
* 5+6 

Q: Should similarity/difference in sequence content correlate with similarity/difference in metadata?
